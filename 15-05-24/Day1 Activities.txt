Day 1 Activities

1. Setting Up the Work Environment:
The first activity involved setting up the work environment. 
This included ensuring that all necessary tools, software, and equipment were properly installed and functioning.
 

2. Ice-Breaking Session:
To help participants get to know each other and foster a collaborative atmosphere, an ice-breaking session was conducted.
Each participant was asked to share three statements about themselves—two truths and one lie. 
The rest of the group then guessed which statement was the lie. 
This activity helped break the ice by encouraging interaction and revealing interesting personal details in a fun and engaging manner.

Share a Motivational Quote and Explain It:
Participants were asked to share a motivational quote that resonates with them and explain why it is meaningful to them. 
This activity not only provided insight into each participant’s values and motivations but also served as a source of inspiration for the group. 
It encouraged positive thinking and set a constructive tone for the team's collaboration.
